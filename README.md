# CS210
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
    This project was built in order to model the return on an investment with compound interest over time and to show the impact of continued investments.
What did you do particularly well?
    I think in this project I did a good job utilizing class inheritance to reduce the amount of redundant code. Most of the code needed for the account with monthly deposits was     shared with the account that did not have monthly deposits and I was able to use inheritance to take advantage of this.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
    I performed most of the account calculations in the Class's "Print" method. In retrospect it would have been more readable and maintainable to keep the calculations in a           separate method.
Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this? What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
    The most challenging part of this project was learning the correct syntax and file setup for utilizing class inheritance. For syntax issues I find it most helpful to make         myself small templates for things I often need to do that have complex syntax and then fill in the blanks. As I continue in my coursework I am slowly building a small syntax       library.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
    Class inheritance will be by far the most important transferable skill from this project. I expect almost all of my future projects will need to utilize this concept.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
    By creating classes and calling well-named methods the main() function is easily readable. This also makes the code more adaptable. If someone was curious how it would affect their investment if they were to make annual deposits into an account with monthly compounded interest this would be a very easy feature to add because the framework for the account is already present and can be inherited.
